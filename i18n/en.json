  "tech_intro": "From curated databases to mechanistic graphs: we synthesize structured knowledge into deterministic systems that run fast and compose cleanly.",
  "tech_point1": "Universal <strong>initial state</strong>: genes, epigenetics, organelles, protein levels → any cell type (neuron, stem, cancer, engineered).",
  "tech_point2": "Mechanistic <strong>ODE/graph models</strong> with feedback loops; no trillion-param training needed.",
  "tech_point3": "<strong>Search engine</strong> to explore disease pathways, targets, apoptosis routes, and drug effects.",
  "tech_point4": "Simple <strong>APIs & visuals</strong> for rapid prototyping, like software.",
  "seo_title": "Who finds SiCell when searching?",
  "seo_intro": "If you’re exploring cell simulation software, computational biology platforms, or mechanistic systems biology tooling, these are the problems we solve every day.",

  "why_title": "Why now?",
  "why_text": "It’s a paradox: we run trillion-parameter AIs trained from scratch, yet biology - where we already know so much - trails behind. We aim to close the gap between silicon on CPUs and carbon in cells, bringing biology into the era of emergent, iterative tooling.",
